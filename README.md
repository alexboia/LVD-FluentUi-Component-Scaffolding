# FluentUI Component Scaffolding

This is a tool to generate the basic structure of a React component built using the [FluentUI](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui) library, including the scripts and configuration requried for publishing it to the `npm` package repository.
This tool uses a built-in template directory, collects some additional data, such as package name, library name, package author and creates:

- the basic directory structure;
- build scripts, `package.json`, webpack configuration files, license file and a standard `.gitignore`;
- empty component file;
- empty stylesheet files;
- basic structure of a demo application to feature the component.

It also runs `npm install` after the package structure has been created.
